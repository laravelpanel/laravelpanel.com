# Add Module to Panel (Create a Package)

You can create your own package using the 'panel' package and add new features to the 'panel'. To do this, you should add your package name to the list of Links in the panel while installing your package. (You should add the code related to this in your installation script.)

Then you need to define the namespace of controllers of your package in the routes to make it work.

You can take a look at our 'blog' package as an example of a package that is written using the panel at https://github.com/serverfireteam/blog.
