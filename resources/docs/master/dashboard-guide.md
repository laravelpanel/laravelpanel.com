## Dashboard Guide

After logging in to your panel, you will be redirected to the dashboard. The dashboard contains a menu at the left sidebar of the page. Each item of the menu except the 'Links' item, is an entity. The 'Links' item contains the list of available entities. So if you want to add a new entity to your website you can add it to the Links.

At the center of the page, for each available entity, a box is displayed. In each box, the name of the entity is displayed and in front of that a number is displayed which specifies the number of records already added. At the bottom of the box there is a 'Show List' link for listing the records of this entity and also there is a 'ADD' button for adding a new record to the entity.

At the top right corner of the page, there is the 'Log Out' button and also 'Setting' drop down section which provides the 'Edit Profile' and 'Reset Password' features.
